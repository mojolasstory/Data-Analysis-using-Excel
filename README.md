# Descriptive-Analysis-using-Excel
**This was a group project done in school by [@mojolasstory](https://github.com/mojolasstory), aswini chacko and suriya Arivanandan.**

We use the data provided to show the behaviour of customers.
The data has several different product types, and records of actual and expected time it takes for customers to complete an order.

With this data we are able to show how long it takes the shop to complete customers order and satisfaction levels.
